# PJPaint
Paige and James Paint - a little flood fill WinForms app written in early 2000's

A simple colouring book program written for my kids back in 2003, it was shareware but after all these years, putting it out there as freeware.  Recompiled to use the .NET framework 4.6, it was in 2.0 and then left as-was.  It uses C#/WinForms and is basically a program built around a good old flood-fill algorithm.  Just download PJPaint.zip and copy the PJPaint directory to your favourite directory.  You can also put additional colouring book images in /Book and stamps into /Stamps if you want to customise.
